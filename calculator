This is the second and last project in introduction to programming

The aim of this project is to create a calculator using pseudocode

The instruction are :
1- take two input as double for the users and assigned them to X and y 
2- take the operation as an input for the user
3- print the output 

My pseudocode :
Var double X 
Var double y 

Print (“Enter operation”)
Input (operation)


 If (X  = string) {
Print (X  “ is not a valid number”)

 If (y = string) {
Print (y  “ is not a valid number”)

Else If (operation  == + ) 
Print X + y  

Else If (operation  == - ) 
Print X - y  

Else If (operation  == * ) 
Print X * y  

Else If (operation  == / ) 
Print X / y  

Else 
Print (“ the wrong operation has been entered, try again”)
