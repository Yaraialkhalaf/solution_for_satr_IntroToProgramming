This is the first project of the two final projects in the course introduction to programming

The aim of the project is to take the first name, last name and ID number of the user and display them using pseudocode

The instructions are :
1- Write a program that receives the First Name, Last Name, and Employee ID from the user. Validate the input according to these rules:

2- Ensure the First Name and Last Name are at least two characters long.

3- Ensure the Employee ID consists of numbers only.

4- Display appropriate error messages for any invalid data.

Example of error : 
Input :
-Enter the first name: J
-Enter the last name:
-Enter the ID: 1234d
Output: 
-"J" is not a valid first name. It is too short.
-The last name must be filled in.
-1234d is not a valid ID.

Explain for the correct output :
-Enter the first name: Jimmy
-Enter the last name: James
-Enter the ID:  123456


My pseudocode : 
String firstName
String lastName
Integer ID

Print (“enter your first name”)
Input (firstName)
Print (“enter your last name”)
Input (lastName)
Print (“enter your ID”)
Input (ID)


If (firstName. Length < 2) {
Print ( firstName “is an incorrect name. It’s too short”)
}

Else If (lastName.Length < 2) {
Print ( lastName “is an incorrect name. It’s too short”)
}

Else If (firstName = null) {
Print ( “the first name must be filled”)
}

Else If (lastName = null) {
Print ( “the last name must be filled”)
}

Else If (ID = null) {
Print ( “ID must be filled”)
}

Else If (ID = string) {
Print ( ID “ is not a valid ID”)
}

Else {
Print ( “ no errors found”)
Print (firstName)
Print (lastName)
Print (ID)
}
